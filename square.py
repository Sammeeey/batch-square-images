# square.py

# functionality in short:
# - so far only a script (command line tool) to "batch-square" .jpg images
# - extends background of images with white color (based on longer side of image)
# - places picture in center of white background

# purpose / reason:
# - create squared images for usage in online shops 

# steps in the script:
# - create "square_images" sub directory if not existent yet
# - process all .jpg images from a certain directory (given by a user) one by one
#   - check width and height to determine long and short side
#   - copy image
# - create new image with white background 

# Props to Al Sweigart for the great book http://automatetheboringstuff.com/
